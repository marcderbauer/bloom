## Context
This project originally started out as an RNN, which I wanted to implement in Pytorch. 
I had difficulties getting the model to create a coherent output. There were many open variables, and I was unsure which ones were working as intended and which ones required further adjustments.
As I lacked reference values for training, I decided to finetune an existing model -- BLOOM.  
I hoped to learn more about the text-generation process from a top-down perspective, and to gather reference values for training in a "best-case" scenario.  
  
## Data
- Pulled data using YouTube API
- Link to more info on how to set up api access
- Include little tutorial

## Training
- How to run this, maybe some hyperparams

## Inference
- How to use inference. Also add argparse

## Conclusion
- How did this help me with RNN
- What did I learn in General?
